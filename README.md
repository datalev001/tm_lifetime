# Optimizing Supply Chain with Time Series Forecasting: A Customer-Centric Approach
Applying Repurchase Prediction Models for Product Demand Forecasting
In this paper, I explore a time series forecasting model  to predict demand in the supply chain industry. I aim to forecast sales for multiple products over the next N days.
I tried several traditional methods, including ARIMA and Prophet, but found that these statistical models weren't quite suitable due to the complexity and diversity of the products. Therefore, I decided to find a better approach.
That's when I thought of a different strategy - using the Lifetimes Python library to predict customer behavior at a granular level.
